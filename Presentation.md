**<p align="center">Project Dissonance is a third person stealth game with a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk setting developed on the Unity Engine. It will feature characters of an anthropomorphic design, brought to life with vibrant cel-shaded visuals.</p>**

_<p align="center">In a world long since ravaged by nuclear warfare, a divided race forms into various factions and new conflicts arise daily over what little of the ruined earth is left behind. One such faction, known as the Pan-Arctic Coalition, or PAC, has recently occupied a long-forgotten military base hidden deep in the mountains. It is believed that this base houses powerful weapons leftover from the old world. As a member of Black Capra, a faction that seeks to end unnecessary conflict from the shadows, it is your mission to infiltrate the base, determine what weapons the PAC may have uncovered there, and sabotage them before the PAC uses them to aid in its conquest.</p>_
